# Filemill, server edition — Tasks

## How tracking works

- **TASKS.md** (this file) is the session-level scratchpad. Use it to track
  work-in-progress and orient a fresh agent at the start of a session.
- **ISSUES.md** is the open-issue registry. Only open or in-progress issues live there;
  closed issues are pruned immediately and their full text is preserved in git history.

**Workflow for an issue:**

1. Add a new issue block to ISSUES.md with `**Status:** open`.
2. When starting work: change status to `in-progress` and add a `[~]` entry below.
3. When done: remove the issue block from ISSUES.md entirely and commit (the git diff
   _is_ the closure record). Move the entry here to **Done** with a one-line summary.

**Status legend for this file:**

## In progress

- [~] #48 Truncate filenames preserving the file extension
- [~] #46 Automatic dark mode following OS colour-scheme preference
- [x] **New UI migration** — the shared Miller-columns frontend runs at `/n/`,
      including VFS navigation and deep links. The legacy HTMX UI remains at
      `/f/` for compatibility.
- [x] #45 Mobile: column bottom clipped + directory nav scrolls to preview
- [~] #43 Mobile preview fills 100 % width; rightmost column peek needed as scroll hint
- [~] #44 ripgrep-based full-text search bar in `<nav>`

---

## Scheduled

- [ ] #49 CSV preview shows "not yet implemented" stub

## Open

_Items without an issue number are not yet tracked in ISSUES.md._

- [ ] #47 Column width & scrolling UX: jumps, long-name stretch, no left-scroll
- [ ] #50 ArrowRight after ArrowLeft loses previously focused item
- [ ] #51 PWA: start the Filemill HTTP service alongside the installed app
- [ ] Pagination for large directories (> 500 entries)
- [ ] PPTX slide image rendering via LibreOffice (better fidelity than text extraction)
- [ ] #52 Markdown raw source view toggle (Rendered / Raw button bar, `MarkdownProvider`)
- [ ] #53 VTT subtitle file preview (Transcript / Raw toggle, `VTTProvider`)

## Done

- [x] **The browser suite runs again** — `pyproject.toml` pins
      `playwright~=1.61.0` instead of flooring at `>=1.57.0`, `README.md` and
      `CONTRIBUTING.md` drop the `--with "playwright==1.57.0"` that broke it, and
      `test_browser_keyboard.py` hands Chromium the credentials from
      `$HTTPS_PROXY`. The 56 browser tests passed; PLAN-19 records what they
      confirmed about the URL contract.
- [x] **Shared frontend with the static edition** — `src/filemill/ui/` is the
      shared frontend itself, which the repository's `../ui/` symlinks to;
      `/api/dir|raw|preview` back it, `POST /api/render` renders local-folder
      bytes through the Python pipeline, and "Open local folder…" switches
      adapters at runtime.
      SQLite/JSON/CSV browse through the same adapter via a `vpath`.
      68 new tests (`test_api.py`, `test_browser_new_ui.py`)

- [x] #39 Canonical `/f/<mount>/<relative>` URLs + legacy `/f/?path=` fallback; align markdown links, browser history sync, VFS URLs, and `pykoclaw-pykofinder`
- [x] #38 CORS on `/w/` – `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` + OPTIONS preflight
- [x] #37 Browser regression now uses the real keyboard-only survival flow
- [x] #36 Browser regression test covers folder-column survival after ArrowLeft/ArrowRight
